# Python

Python is a 
- a high level <font color="gray"><i>(which basically means it is user-friendly, concise i.e. to the point (context-wise) and independent of the computer's hardware architecture i.e. you usually end up writing simple code that is generally kept away from a computer's hardware-specific operation)</i></font>
- general purpose <font color="gray">(which means it is not just dedicated to a single application domain, it can be applied to a wide range of purposes)</font>

programming language.

Python is being used in 
- web development 
- machine learning applications

with python, we can
- do web-scraping <font color="gray">(like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)</font> 
- learn Django web framework <font color="gray">(used in YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)</font>
- achieve deep learning
- test framework
- multimedia
- scientific computing 
- text processing etc.


Python uses interpreter to run the code, unlike Java which is a compiler-based language.
Therefore, python executes instructions directly without requiring them to be previously
compiled into machine code.

## Why python?
1. code readability, shorter code, ease of writing.
2. we can express logical lines of code in a fewer lines of code in comparison to Java or C++.
3. it is a multi-paradigm language viz. object-oriented, imperative, functional.

Both functions and procedures are subroutines that are used for re-executing a predefined block of code. Only that, function may return a value but procedures do not.</font>
